# Memory Card Game

The Memory Card Game is a web-based game where players test their memory skills by matching pairs of football (soccer) player cards. The objective is to accumulate as many points as possible without clicking on the same image more than once. 

This project aims to provide an entertaining and challenging gaming experience while showcasing the use of modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack
The project is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for web pages.
- **CSS**: A styling language used to enhance the visual appearance of the game.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used to add interactivity and logic to the game.
- **Git**: A version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.

## Approach
The project follows a component-based architecture using React, which helps in organizing and managing the game's UI components. The gameboard is dynamically generated using a grid layout, and each card is represented as a separate component.

Key steps in building the game include:

1. Setting up the project structure and installing necessary dependencies.
2. Designing and implementing the game's UI components, such as the header, gameboard, and scoreboard.
3. Implementing the game logic, including tracking clicks, earning points, and handling game over conditions.
4. Styling the game components using CSS to create an appealing and user-friendly interface.
5. Testing and refining the game to ensure smooth gameplay and an enjoyable user experience.

## Challenges

- **Memory tracking**: Implementing the logic to track clicked images and detect duplicates to prevent clicking on the same image multiple times.
- **Scoring system**: Designing a scoring system that accurately rewards points for correct clicks and penalizes for incorrect clicks.
- **Responsive design**: Creating a responsive layout that works well across different screen sizes and devices while maintaining the game's visual appeal.
- **Game flow**: Ensuring a smooth flow of gameplay, including providing feedback on clicks, updating the score, and handling game over conditions.
